The Services are owned and operated by PAYWITHME. The Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Site by PAYWITHME. BY USING OR ACCESSING ANY PART OF THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN AND ALL OTHER OPERATING RULES, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT MAY BE PUBLISHED FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE SITE BY PAYWITHME. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF SUCH TERMS, CONDITIONS, RULES, POLICIES OR PROCEDURES, DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES.</p>

        <h4>1.2 Key Terms</h4>

        <p>“Event Closing” refers to an event that “closes” meaning that it stops collecting payments and all payments will be submitted for settlement. This close time is set by the Host and usually occurs before the event itself.</p>
        <p>“Guest” refers to a member who has joined an event.</p>
        <p>“Host” refers to a member who has created and listed an event via the site, application and services.</p>
        <p>“Member” is a person that has joined the site or application via completion of PAYWITHME’s registration process (including doing so through Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, LinkedIn or any similar entity)</p>

        <h4>1.3 Modification.</h4>

        <p>PAYWITHME reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the terms or conditions of this TOS at any time. It is your responsibility to check this TOS periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of any changes to this TOS constitutes acceptance of those changes.

        <h4>1.4 Language.</h4>
        <p>We may translate this Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy or any other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Site into other languages for your convenience. The English language version of each of these documents is the version that governs your use of the Services and in the event of any conflict between the English language version and a translated version, the English language version will control.</p>

        <h3>2. DESCRIPTION OF PAYWITHME.</h3>

        <p>PayWithMe is a platform that allows event Hosts to connect with event Guests through various social networks and contact lists, and allows those event Hosts to collect money from their guests to fund specific events they are hosting. Event Hosts visit the Site to create an event page with specifics of the event and payment information. This will allow the event Hosts to collect payments directly from event guests. Payments are all transacted through PayPal, Dwolla, WePay or other third party payment service methods (collectively, "Facilitated Payment Modes" or "FPM") This TOS applies to you and your use of the Services as a Guest and/or Host.</p>

        <h3>3. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</h3>
        <h4>3.1 The Services.</h4>

        <p>PAYWITHME hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub licensable right to access and use the Services solely for the purposes of browsing the Site, and searching for, viewing, registering for, and interacting with, and creating an event that is registered on the Site, in each case (i) in compliance with this TOS, and (ii) to the extent permitted under all applicable laws and regulations (foreign and domestic). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not, and shall not permit anyone else to, directly or indirectly: (i) modify, reproduce or otherwise create derivatives of any part of the Services or Site Content (as defined below); (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence and organization of all or any part of the Services (except that this restriction shall not apply to the limited extent restrictions on reverse engineering are prohibited by applicable local law); (iii) rent, lease, resell, distribute or use the Services for timesharing, service bureau, or commercial purposes; (iv) remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on or in the Services or Site Content; (v) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services; or (vi) engage in any fraudulent activity or activity that facilitates fraud.</p>

        <h3>4. PAYMENT.</h3>

        <h4>4.1 Fees and Delays</h4>
        <p>When a host elects to use PAYWITHME as a payment collection service, that host agrees to the fees and delays that accompany that service. PAYWITHME charges the host 1.1% + $.50 for each guest that attends an event by paying through PAYWITHME. Guests are also charged 2.9% + $.30 per transaction for credit card and processing fees. These payment options will also cause a delay of 2 or more days before a host receives their payment. It is our intent, but we cannot warrantee, that funds will be transmitted to Hosts in 3-5 business days or less. Plan for possible delays in payment when scheduling an event close out in the case that such funds are required to be in hand by the Host prior to the event. If your event has closed more than 7 days ago and you still haven’t received your payment feel free to email support@paywith.me or call (518) 276-2393 , please include the date that your event closed and name of the event as well as any reference numbers or code that you receive from PAYWITHME.</p>

        <h4>4.1 Independent Relationship of FPMs.</h4>
        <p>When using a FPM, Hosts and Guests effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.</p>

        <h4>4.2 Refunds.</h4>
        <p>PAYWITHME IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR REFUNDS.. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Host and Guest. PAYWITHME will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the Services. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks and refunds are to be conducted between the Host and Guest. PAYWITHME will not be responsible or liable in any way for chargebacks in connection with a Guest's use of the Services. If you are a Guest and you wish to request a refund in connection with an event that has already closed, you should contact the applicable Host directly. PAYWITHME does not endorse, govern, review, warrant or in any way guarantee the host’s identity, validity, reliability or ability to deliver. Therefore, conduct business only with trusted parties knowing that PAYWITHME assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of the host including but not limited to fraud, misrepresentations, cancelation following an event close out, safety and security of any person or persons or any physical property, safety or security of any venue or location, compliance of host with any laws, regulations or statutes.</p>

        <h4>4.3 Credit Card Processing (CCP).</h4>

        <p>(a) Gateway; Payment Process.</p>
        <p>When a Host elects to use the Gateway for the collection of Event Registration Fees, payment processing occurs directly through PAYWITHME. Under the CCP option, PAYWITHME will collect all Event Registration Fees on behalf of the Host from Guests and deduct all applicable Services Fees from the Event Registration Fees collected by PAYWITHME before passing the remainder along to the Host, provided that PAYWITHME reserves the right to withhold funds (i) at any time as PAYWITHME determines to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, and other discrepancies and (ii) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this TOS. PAYWITHME, in its sole discretion, may determine to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Host prior to the period set forth above, on such terms and conditions as PAYWITHME may establish from time to time. Host agrees that all Event Registration Fees for a given event are earned by Host only following conclusion of the applicable event and all Event Registration Fees ultimately due will include all Service Fees, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and other deductions, whether due to customer complaints, allegations of fraud, discrepancies related to the applicable event or otherwise. No payments shall be made to a Host from PAYWITHME with respect to any event that is cancelled. If payments have already been made by PAYWITHME to a Host for a cancelled event, such Host will be responsible for delivery of guest refunds. (See our refund policy 4.2 and 4.3(b).) All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars.</p>

        <p>(a) Refunds.</p>
        <p>PAYWITHME does not offer refunds. It is the responsibility of the Host to communicate its refund policy to Guests and to issue refunds to Guests after the event has closed out. A Host shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this TOS and the payment and refund mechanics of the Site. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Host and Guest, and PAYWITHME will not be responsible or liable for, and Host hereby agrees to fully indemnify PAYWITHME and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the site.</p>

        <h4>4.4 Non-Exclusive Remedies.</h4>

        <p>(a) Confirmation.</p>
        <p>Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual event registration fee, PAYWITHME generates a confirmation message. The Host agrees to unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all ticketing commitments that have been confirmed by PAYWITHME through the Services, and it is the user’s responsibility to verify the Guest's membership status, confirmation number and/or any event restrictions prior to the subject event.</p>

        <p>(b) Taxes; Withholding.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for (and will indemnify PAYWITHME and its affiliates against) all taxes associated with your activities on the Services (excepting taxes based on PAYWITHME’s net income), which amounts may be withheld from payments due to you or invoiced to you. In addition, if in a given calendar year PAYWITHME processes transactions for your account (i) for more than $20,000 in gross sales and (ii) in more than 200 order transactions, PAYWITHME is required to report those transactions to the Internal Revenue Service, along with your name, address and Tax Identification Number. PAYWITHME will contact you during the year for this information if you meet these thresholds.</p>

        <p>PAYWITHME reserves the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to you hereunder if (i) PAYWITHME suspects or determines that such amounts have been generated in (A) a fraudulent manner, (B) violation of this TOS, or (C) violation of any applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic), or (ii) PAYWITHME is required to do so by applicable laws or regulations (foreign or domestic). Such withholding may be temporary or permanent (as determined by PAYWITHME). PAYWITHME reserves the right to deny or cancel service to any party that violates its terms of use or that is viewed, in PAYWITHME’s sole discretion, as offensive to our users.</p>
