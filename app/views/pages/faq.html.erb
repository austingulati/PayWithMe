      <h3>Is PayWithMe free to use?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        Yes! You can create an event, invite members and start collecting money at no charge. Those who you are collecting from, however, are subject to small fees if they use an online payment processor.
      </div>

      <h3>Payment Processors?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        Payment processors are services such as PayPal, Dwolla and WePay. Fees for events are based on the payment processor used by the organizer.
      </div>

      <h3>How does PayWithMe make money?</h3>
      <div class="well">
        PayWithMe adds a minimal charge to each transaction but does not charge the organizer. PayWithMe adds a 3.0% + $0.80 fee to transactions that use PayPal and WePay while adding $0.50 to transactions over Dwolla. These are based entirely on the individual payment processor.
